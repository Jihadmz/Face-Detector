# Face-Detector
This machine learning model uses **OpenCV** library of python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
In this project the dataset used for training the model is a bunch of humans face collected by some contributors, you can get it [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

- First: download the project
- Second: look for data->haarcascades->haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
- Finally: copy it to your project folder and use it

## OpenCV
Before trying to modify this project on your own, you should install opencv library on your system, for that head to [this page](https://opencv.org/releases/) to download it,
**or** you can download it by typing **pip install python-opencv** in the terminal, and if you face any problems just append to the command **-headless** and it should work.
**Unfortunately** for me the command didn't worked for me (Im running fedora 34), so I installed it using dnf **sudo dnf install python-opencv**.
### Finally you are good to go
